## dragino LoRaWAN Gateway configuration

If pre-existent data are present, please reset dragino:

- Press toggle button while dragino is running for about 30 seconds.

Connect to dragino access point with any device (pc suggested).
Open on your browser at link: [10.130.1.1](10.130.1.1) or via url: *dragino-`<same code of WiFi Access Point>`*

| Login | |
| --- | --- |
| user: | root |
| pass: | dragino |

### dragino network settings

- Network > *Internet Access*
  - Select WiFi connection
  - Set WiFi password and SSID
  - Set a page for ping test (like www.google.it)
  - **Save**
- Network > *Access Point*
  - Disable WiFi AP
  - **Save**
- Unsaved changes
  - **Save & Apply**
  - Wait for about 2 minutes and reboot.

### Setting up WLAN connection

- Network > *Internet Access*
  - Select WLAN connection
- Unsaved changes
  - **Save & Apply**
  - Wait for about 2 minutes and reboot.

### Setting up TTN data

- Open [TheThingsNetwork](thethingsnetwork.org) and go to Gateways settings.
- Register a new Gateway with **legacy packed forwarder**
- Copy the address on the back of the dragino and add a number like between (00 00) and (FF FF).
- Add a description.
- Set *Frequency Plan*
- Register your gateway.

Open on your browser dragino IP (based on your network).

- Sensor > LoraWAN
  - Server address: (example) router.eu.thethings.network
  - **Save & Apply**
- Sensor > IOT Server
  - IoT Server: LoRaWAN
  - **Save & Apply**

## Firmware

### LoRaWan on Mbed

All the comunication system is based on LoRaWAN stack protocol managed by STM32 microcontroller board `DISCO-L072CZ`, programmed by `Mbed` (www.mbed.com). Firmware uses `Mbed OS 5` to provide drivers and pre-built code for:

- LoRaWAN radio module: SX1276
- Analog Input/Output
- Digital GPIOs
- Debug and tracing
- RS232 over USB stack

Code is divided in two main *blocks*:

 1. System initialization: `main.cpp`
 2. mbed-os configuration (LoRaWAN login): `mbed_app.json`

## System initialization

In the `main.cpp` file, there are all the functions/declarations needed to deploy the **send data function**.
The user has to change the `ID` constant in the file, as a hexadecimal value of 16 bit (`uint16_t`):

``` c++
...
    #define ID              0xAAFF
...
```

Sensor, for the board used in the project, is addressed on pin analog 1 (`A1`). Change it in case of need. Pin `A0` can't be used.

```c++
...
    AnalogIn sensor(A1);
...
```

In the `send_data()` function the user can set any kind of encoding of transmitted data, writing the correct message into the `tx_buffer` and settings the correct dimension value of it, into `packet_len` variable.

```c++
    ...
    static void send_message()
    {
        uint16_t packet_len;
        int16_t retcode;

        /*
            Reading sensor data (unsigned int 16 bit)
            Writing ID and sensor data into transmission buffer
            Sending data to Gateway by LoRaWAN stack
        */
        uint16_t data = sensor.read_u16();
        packet_len = sprintf(
            (char *) tx_buffer, "%4X%u", ID, data);

        printf("\r\ndata sent: %s\r\n", tx_buffer);
    ...
    }
```

## LoRaWAN login configuration

In the `mbed_app.json` file, each user **NEED TO CONFIGURE** their own *TheTingsNetwork* credential to their proper application.

Note:
> This code works only for `APB` protocol. The `OOTA` way isn't verificated yet.
> For all information about *TheTingsNetwork* procedures, please refer to www.thethingsnetwork.com.

In order to change radio module, set the proper value in:

```json
...
    "config": {
        "lora-radio": {
            "help": "Which radio to use (options: SX1272,SX1276)",
            "value": "SX1276"
        },
...
```

For *TheThingsNetwork* credentials, change:

```json
...
    "target_overrides": {
        "*": {
            ...
            "lora.appskey": "{C-STYLE HEX App Session Key}",
            "lora.nwkskey": "{C-STYLE HEX Network Session Key}",
            "lora.device-address": "0x<HEX DATA OF device address>"
...
```
